This repository reproduces a bug I'm experiencing when running tests against a
React component that uses a dynamic import. I do not encounter this with webpack
v3.6.0, but I do with webpack v3.10.0.

To install dependencies:

```shell
$ yarn install
# OR
$ npm install
```

To run the app in the browser:

```shell
$ yarn start
# OR
$ npm start
```

To see the tests fail:

```shell
$ yarn test
# OR
$ npm test
```
